\title{Calculate Performance Metrics}
\usage{
calc_metrics(
  gains = NULL,
  metrics = c("cagr", "mdd", "mean", "sd", "sharpe", "alpha.annualized", "beta", "r"),
  prices = NULL,
  tickers = NULL,
  ...,
  benchmark = "SPY"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gains}{Data frame with one column of gains for each investment and a
date variable named Date.}

\item{metrics}{Character vector specifying metrics to calculate. Choices are
\code{"cagr"} for compound annualized growth rate, \code{"mdd"} for max
drawdown, \code{"mean"}, \code{"sd"}, \code{"sharpe"}, \code{"growth.x"} for
growth of $x where x is the initial value, \code{"growth"} for percent
growth, \code{"sortino"}, \code{"alpha"}, \code{"alpha.annualized"},
\code{"beta"}, \code{"r.squared"}, \code{"pearson"} or \code{"spearman"} for
Pearson/Spearman correlation with benchmark, and \code{"auto.pearson"} or
\code{"auto.spearman"} for Pearson/Spearman autocorrelation.}

\item{prices}{Data frame with one column of prices for each investment and a
date variable named Date.}

\item{tickers}{Character vector of ticker symbols that Yahoo! Finance
recognizes, if you want to download data on the fly.}

\item{...}{Arguments to pass along with \code{tickers} to
\code{\link{load_gains}}.}

\item{benchmark}{Character string specifying which fund to use as a
benchmark for metrics that require one.}
}
\value{
Data frame with performance metrics for each investment.
}
\description{
Useful for comparing funds on one or more metrics.

# Calculate performance metrics for FANG stocks since the beginning of 2019

# alpha and beta)
