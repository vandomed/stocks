\arguments{
\item{contango}{Numeric vector of contango values at the end of each trading 
day.}

\item{xiv.gains}{Numeric vector of gains for XIV. Should be same length as 
\code{contango} and date-shifted one value to the right. For example, the 
first value of \code{xiv.gains} should be the XIV gain for the day AFTER the 
first contango value.}

\item{vxx.gains}{Numeric vector of gains for VXX. Should be same length as 
\code{contango} and date-shifted one value to the right. For example, the 
first value of \code{vxx.gains} should be the VXX gain for the day AFTER the 
first contango value.}

\item{xiv.cutpoint}{Numeric value giving the contango cutpoint for XIV, in 
percent.}

\item{vxx.cutpoint}{Numeric value giving the contango cutpoint for VXX, in 
percent.}

\item{initial}{Numeric value giving the initial value of the portfolio.}
}
\value{
List containing: 
\enumerate{
\item Character vector named \code{holdings} indicating what fund was held 
each day (XIV, VXX, or cash). 
\item Numeric vector named \code{port.gains} giving the portfolio gain for 
each day, which will be 0 for days that cash was held and the XIV or VXX gain 
for days that XIV or VXX was held. 
\item Numeric vector named \code{port.balances} giving the portfolio balance 
each day. 
\item Numeric value named \code{trades} giving the total number of trades 
executed.
}
}
\description{
Simple strategy: Each day, hold XIV if contango > \code{xiv.cutpoint}, hold 
VXX if contango < \code{vxx.cutpoint}, and hold cash otherwise. Perhaps not 
very useful since XIV closed on Feb. 20, 2018.

\details{
You can find historical contango values from The Intelligent Investor Blog. 
You can click the first link at \url{http://investing.kuchita.com/2012/06/28/xiv-data-and-pricing-model-since-vix-futures-available-2004/} to download a zip file containing an Excel spreadsheet. Then, 
you will need to calculate whatever version of "contango" you prefer. I 
typically define contango as what percent higher the second-month VIX futures 
are acompared to the first-month futures, i.e. dividing the "2nd mth" column 
by the "1st mth" column, subtracting 1, and then multiplying by 100.

I think the most common approach for contango-based volatility strategies is 
holding XIV (inverse volatility) when contango is above some value (e.g. 0\%, 
5\%, or 10\%), and holding cash otherwise. You can do that with this function 
by leaving \code{vxx.cutpoint} as \code{-Inf}. However, you may also want to 
hold VXX (volatility) when contango is below some value 
(e.g. 0\%, -5\%, -10\%), also known as "backwardation". You can implement an 
XIV-only, VXX-only, or XIV and VXX strategy with this function.

To load daily gains for XIV and/or VXX, you can use \code{\link{load_gains}}, 
which uses the \pkg{quantmod} package to load data from Yahoo! Finance. You 
will have to specify the \code{from} and \code{to} inputs to match the date 
range for your contango values.
