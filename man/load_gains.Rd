load_gains(
  tickers,
  intercepts = NULL,
  slopes = NULL,
  from = "1950-01-01",
  to = Sys.Date(),
  time.scale = "daily",
  preto.days = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{tickers}{Character vector of ticker symbols that Yahoo! Finance
recognizes, or "^CASH" for cash.}

\item{intercepts}{Numeric vector of values to add to daily gains for each
fund.}

\item{slopes}{Numeric vector of values to multiply daily gains for each fund
by. Slopes are multiplied prior to adding intercepts.}

\item{from}{Date or character string, e.g. \code{"2015-01-15"}.}

\item{to}{Date or character string, e.g. \code{"2018-12-31"}.}

\item{time.scale}{Character string. Choices are \code{"daily"},
\code{"monthly"}, and \code{"yearly"}.}

\item{preto.days}{Numeric value. If specified, function returns gains for
\code{preto.days} trading days prior to \code{to}. For example, to load the
most recent 50 daily gains, leave \code{to} and \code{time.scale} as the
defaults and set \code{preto.days = 50}.}

\item{prefrom.days}{Numeric value. If specified, function returns gains for
\code{prefrom.days} trading days prior to \code{from}. Useful when you want
to test a trading strategy starting on a particular date, but the strategy
requires data leading up to that date (e.g. trailing beta).}

\item{mutual.lifetimes}{Logical value for whether to start on the first day
and end on the last day of the funds' mutual lifetimes (within \code{from}
and \code{to}).}

\item{mutual.start}{Logical value for whether to start on the first day of
the funds' mutual lifetimes.}

\item{mutual.end}{Logical value for whether to end on the last day of the
funds' mutual lifetimes.}

\item{drop.anyNA}{Logical value for whether to drop dates on which prices are
missing for any of the funds.}

Data frame with gains for each fund.
